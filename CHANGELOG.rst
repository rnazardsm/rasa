^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Added
-----
- added arguments to set the file paths for interactive training
- added quick reply representation for command-line output
- added option to specify custom button type for Facebook buttons
- added tracker store persisting trackers into a SQL database
  (``SQLTrackerStore``)
- added rasa command line interface and API
- Rasa Stack HTTP training endpoint at ``POST /jobs``. This endpoint
  will train a combined Rasa Core and NLU model
- ``ReminderCancelled(action_name)`` event to cancel given action_name reminder
  for current user
- Rasa Stack HTTP intent evaluation endpoint at ``POST /intentEvaluation``.
  This endpoints performs an intent evaluation of a Rasa Stack model
- option to create template for new utterance action in ``interactive learning``
- you can now choose actions previously created in the same session
in ``interactive learning``
- add formatter 'black'


Changed
-------
- renamed ``rasa_core`` package to ``rasa.core``
- for interactive learning only include manually annotated and ner_crf entities in nlu export
- made ``message_id`` an additional argument to ``interpreter.parse``
- changed removing punctuation logic in ``WhitespaceTokenizer``
- ``training_processes`` in the Rasa NLU data router have been renamed to ``worker_processes``
- created a common utils package ``rasa.utils`` for nlu and core, common methods like ``read_yaml`` moved there
- removed ``--num_threads`` from run command (server will be asyncronous but
  running in a single thread)
- ``rasa train`` uses fallback config if an invalid config is given

Removed
-------
- removed possibility to execute ``python -m rasa_core.train`` etc. (e.g. scripts in ``rasa.core`` and ``rasa.nlu``).
  Use the CLI for rasa instead, e.g. ``rasa train core``.
- removed ``_sklearn_numpy_warning_fix`` from the ``SklearnIntentClassifier``

Fixed
-----
- evaluating core stories with two stage fallback gave an error, trying to handle None for a policy
- the ``/evaluate`` route for the Rasa NLU server now runs evaluation
  in a parallel process, which prevents the currently loaded model unloading
- added missing implementation of the ``keys()`` function for the Redis Tracker
  Store
- ``rasa nlu test`` doesn't error anymore when a test file is passed with ``-u``
- in interactive learning: only updates entity values if user changes annotation
